## EmulationStation Theme: Cygnus - Blue Flames
Cygnus Blue Flames is an adapted theme, available from the ES-x Theme Browser, that displays large preview images, videos, marquees, all title-oriented metadata and some useful user-oriented metadata.

This adaptation gives full credit to the original author, Steve Boswell (ChoccyHobNob).

**NOTE: Cygnus Blue Flames uses cutting edge features. You will need the latest official emulaionstation for the video, marquee, and carousel features to work correctly. Update from the RetroPie setup menu, manage packages, core, emulationstation. It doesn't work with OMXplayer**

### Installing Cygnus - Blue Flames

 Cygnus - Blue Flames is included in the theme installer in retropie-setup so that's probably the easiest way to install it!_ **SEE line 59 - DTEAM-1/cygnus-blue-flames**

#### DTEAM-1 Update
Cygnus_- Blue flames is based on the work of "ChoccyHobNob". 
Changes:
-  More systems for Lr-Mess / MAMEDEV and +.
-  I changed a lot of images and logos. I have added system images with controllers/gamepads. Originally we didn't see the joysticks/gamepads. 
-  Also, I changed the background to blue flames.
-  I slightly changed the position of the videos, marquees and the 3D box
-  New default theme for uncovered systems (theme.xml)

Note:-
- Don't use OMXplayer.
- To do list: Add "mascots" for systems without one.


### Cygnus - Blue flames theme config file
There are two files included below by the config.xml file, one is a colorset, the other is a template.
Valid changes you can make here are as follows.

#### Colorsets
- cygnus.xml             <--- This is the default blue flames colorscheme.  <----- the good one
- mono.xml               <--- This is a black and grey colorscheme.  
- terminal.xml           <--- This is a green colorscheme.  

#### Templates
- cygnus.xml             <--- All bells & whistles. Lots of metadata, lots of art.  <----- the good one
- nometa.xml             <--- No metadata, all text except gamelist removed.  
- simpleart.xml          <--- Large art, no overlayed boxart or marquee images.  
- simpleart-nometa.xml   <--- Minimal theme with just a gamelist and large art.  

### Platform Specific Themes
Cygnus - Blue flames comes with a large number of defined systems, more than even the default carbon theme. It's probably one of the most completed theme on for RetroPie. 

This is useful if you want to override the display of systems to match your region and things like that. For example, by default Cygnus uses a picture of the USA SNES console and logo for the snes system; you can change this behaviour by telling it to use either the 'sfc' theme or the 'snes-pal' theme to get the correct console and logo for you.

Create a file in `/opt/retropie/configs/all/platforms.cfg` if it doesn't already exist. Edit the file and add lines to it in the format \<system\>_theme="\<themename\>" so in our example above I could add

`snes_theme="sfc"`  
or    
`snes_theme="snes-pal"`    

other useful ones are:-

`megadrive_theme="genesis"`    
`pcengine_theme="tg16"`    
`nes_theme="famicom"`    

There are lots of these, look at the folder names for a list of all the available systems!
